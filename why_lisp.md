Really easy syntax - it's just brackets & your text editor/IDE does the formatting for you.

It changes how one thinks about programming problems - at least for me - and you donâ€™t have to loose the things you like about other languages.

Lots of great books that will really help you grow as a programmer & software engineer. Some free ones that make you a better programmer and design programs like an engineer:

Not free but worth every penny:

After these it is worth remembering there are four main lisps in use today:
* **Common Lisp** - multiple implementations - mostly standard compliant
* **Scheme** - many implementations but check out Chez and Guile Scheme
* **Racket** - a descendant of scheme but had diverged so much by 2010 the developers gave it a new name
* **Clojure** - a lisp on the JVM that has seen significant adoption in industry

These are DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.

These all have great documentation:
* https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html
* https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/
* https://docs.racket-lang.org
* https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started

And more advanced material:
* http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/
* Lisp in Small Pieces
* http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html - well worth a read but beware it is NOT accurate in its description of scheme any more

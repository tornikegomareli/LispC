# Lisp Interpreter in C

This repository contains the code from the tech talk **"Hackers Learn by Building: From zero to Eval, creating Lisp"** presented at [Hacktoberfest 2025](https://hacktoberfest.ge).

## About the Talk

This was a live coding session demonstrating how to build a Lisp interpreter from scratch in C. The session walked through the fundamental concepts of:

- Tokenization and lexical analysis
- Parsing and Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Evaluation and the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- Core Lisp constructs and primitives

## Building

```bash
gcc main.c -o lisp
./lisp
```

## What's Inside

This is a minimal Lisp implementation showcasing the core concepts needed to understand how programming languages work under the hood. The code prioritizes clarity and educational value over performance or completeness.
